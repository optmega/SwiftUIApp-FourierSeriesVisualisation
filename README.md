# SwiftUIApp-FourierSeriesVisualisation

This little app visualises different [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) using epicycles and a graph.

The number of functions and the type of series can be changed. The following series are supported:

* Square Wave
* Saw Tooth
* Triangle
* Pulse

It builds and runs on iOS and macOS using Catalyst.

I started this little project to familiarise myself a bit more with SwiftUI and its drawing APIs. It is not meant to be perfect SwiftUI and I am sure there are probably better ways of doing things. Any feedback is appreciated!
